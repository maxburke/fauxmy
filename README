* Configure ODBC driver for correct server.
* Set connection string to point to ODBC name.
* Remember to configure both 32 and 64-bit ODBC driver managers on Windows. By default the ODBC manager available in the start menu is the 64-bit one, which means you need to run the 32-bit version manually. It is located here: C:\Windows\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe
* For some reason the Windows authentication isn't working. SQL authentication works fine though
* This connection string works: Driver={SQL Server Native Client 11.0};Server=.\\SQLEXPRESS;UID=<user>;PWD=<password>
